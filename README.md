## Setup Instructions/requirements

In order for you to run these files you will have to create you own .env. files since they are excluded from the repo via .gitignore, they are essential environment variables that connect the two databases locally.

First create 2 files called ".env.test" and ".env.development" in the outer most folder of this repository.

Within the '.env.test' file write "PGDATABASE=nc_news_test"and in the '.env.development' file write "PGDATABASE=nc_news" (without the quotation marks or semi-colons)
